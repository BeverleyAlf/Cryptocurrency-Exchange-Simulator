# Cryptocurrency-Exchange-Simulator
A simulated cryptocurrency exchange platform where users can trade with virtual funds.

Please note that, here i provied a detailed outline and core code structure, however please understand that building a complete exchange simulator requires more extensive development and considerations for security, user authentication, and real-time market data. Below is a detailed outline of the main components and functionalities you should consider when building the simulator.

Step 1: Set Up Dependencies
Before starting, ensure you have the required libraries installed. For this simulator, you'll need Flask for creating a web application and SQLite for the database.

pip install Flask SQLAlchemy

Step 2: Database Setup
Create a SQLite database and define the necessary tables for storing user accounts, virtual funds, transaction history, and other relevant data.

Step 3: Implement User Registration and Authentication
Build endpoints for user registration, login, and logout. Store user credentials securely in the database, and use Flask's session management for user authentication.

Step 4: Design the User Interface
Create HTML templates and CSS stylesheets for the user interface. Include pages for account registration, login, trading dashboard, balance overview, transaction history, etc.

Step 5: User Account and Virtual Funds
Implement functions to create user accounts and assign virtual funds to each user upon registration. The virtual funds represent the starting balance for users to simulate trading.

Step 6: Market Data Simulation
To simulate real market data, use historical price data for cryptocurrencies. You can use historical data from public APIs or generated mock data.

Step 7: Order Placement and Trade Execution
Create functions for placing market orders (buy/sell at the current market price) and limit orders (buy/sell at a specific price). Implement logic for executing trades and updating user balances accordingly.

Step 8: Transaction History
Store completed trades in the database and display the transaction history for each user.

Step 9: Real-Time Market Price Display (Optional)
For an advanced simulator, implement WebSocket integration to display real-time market prices.
